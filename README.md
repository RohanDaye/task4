This Java program represents a simple currency converter. It takes user input for an amount in a source currency, the exchange rate to USD, and the target currency. It then calculates and displays the equivalent amount in the target currency.

Let's break down the key parts of the code:

Input Gathering:

The program uses a Scanner to obtain user input.
The user is prompted to enter:
An amount in the source currency.
The exchange rate to USD.
The target currency code (e.g., EUR, GBP).
Conversion Calculation:

The program calculates the equivalent amount in the target currency by multiplying the source amount by the exchange rate.
Output Display:

The converted amount is then printed to the console, along with the target currency code.
Resource Closing:

The Scanner is closed to prevent resource leaks.
